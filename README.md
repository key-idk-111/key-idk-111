# About Me

## Tech & Linux
- I used to daily-drive **Arch Linux** and loved its rolling-release nature, though these days I mostly use Windows.  
- For servers, I prefer **AlmaLinux**.  
- My go-to desktop environments are **GNOME** or **Hyprland** - KDE Plasma is not my thing.  
- I miss the true customizability of Linux.

## Speedrunning
- I'm involved in the *Getting Over It* community, but ironically, I don't speedrun it.  
- Instead, I speedrun a Roblox game called *Ball and Axe*.

## Development
- I do web development with a focus on **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and especially **TailwindCSS**.  
- I also develop Discord bots, and I've been at it for a little over a year.  
- My memory works in mysterious ways—I learn languages quickly, then later wonder how I understood them in the first place.

## Art
- I create digital art, mostly drawing **cats** and sometimes **cat girls**.

## Old Computers
- I emulate old systems like the **Commodore V2** (I think that's the name, if I'm not mistaken).

## Customization & Workflow
- Customizing my setup is essential to maintaining focus. I love tweaking every detail to improve my workflow.

## Music
- Music is a huge part of my day—over **50%** of my time is spent listening to it.  
- Nighttime is when I truly go ham.
- I love bass. Good sounding bass, not just rattles-

## Discord
- You can find me on Discord under the username **key.111**.
